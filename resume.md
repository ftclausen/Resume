## What I Can Offer

I am an infrastructure automation developer and I particularly 
enjoy working at the intersection of development and operations; 
helping each team understand the needs of the other and, 
at a technical level, creating the tools and processes to make 
the various components of a given service, or interoperating services, 
work smoothly. I am also keen to contribute to the core products in 
order to further advance scalability and manageability.

## Proficiency Summary

My proficiencies cover the following areas

* **Development Support** - Contributing to build engineering tasks such as
    build system code, version control and Continuous Integration (CI)
    systems management.
* **Infrastructure Code and Orchestration** - A combination of configuration management and tool
    development in various scripting languages to support 
    automated infrastructure and application management. This includes using
    container orchestration tools like Kubernetes (K8s) and Mesos/Marathon.
* **Application Administration** - Supporting, primarily Java, web applications with regard to
    provisioning, performance tuning and troubleshooting.
* **Systems Administration and Networking** - Managing, in as automated a way as possible, Linux 
    and Unix systems with regard to installation, ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting. Network 
    management experience has given me good grasp of networking configuration and how the servers 
    I manage fit into the larger network.

Spoken languages

* English - Native speaker
* Dutch - Fluent speaker
